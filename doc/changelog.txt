  issues.

* Deal with (randomized) 'slashdot beta' layout for main page
* Add 'force_reload' link to failed page requests. (Note: beta layout
  not parsed for comments pages)

v4.3 (11th July 2011)
* Bugfix: CSS cookie did not work in Perl version >= 5.10.1.
* Changed icons (again).
* Added 'Apply and return' button on preferences page.
* Changed title 'Slashdot' to 'Avantslash'

  shown to the user. (Slashdot is not working today).
* Bugfix time-zone translation.
* Move avantify.config to 'config.dist'. Local settings go to
  'config.local'.
* Add time zone translation and date formatting; config variables
  TIMEZONE and TIME_FMT.

* Removed serif.css again, makes no sense.
* Changed update checker to use fourteenminutes.com/.../checkupdate.cgi.
* Put notice about usage tracking in readme and config example.

* Add noindex robot tag if user agent looks like a bot.
* Added 'dark' color scheme for reading in the dark.
* Demo mode: move default demo settings; hide cache stats from user.
* Now also redirect links to individual comments ('see this earlier
  post').
* [Thread] links have lower threshold.
* Change cache control for css to prevent checking css time stamp.
* Introduced 'demo_mode'. Limited functionality; safe for public
  use. Differences with standard mode: no search, only show older
  issues, maximum queries per IP address, referrer checking, robots
  noindex, limited number of comments/stories, long cache lifetime.
* More tweaking algorithm for dispaying [Thread] links.
* [Thread] links at more relevant locations
* Bugfix: display correct 'posted' in non-thread mode.
* Added timeout mechanism. Current values 30 seconds for slashdot.org
  and 8 seconds for 'fourteenminutes.com'. This is because AvantSlash
  sometimes stalls while waiting for Fourteenminutes; also we don't
  want to make AvantSlash unusable when Fourteenminutes happens to be
  offline.
* Now the URL is stored in the cached file and $fetch_info{url} is
  also defined when the URL was taken from the cache. Comes in handy
  when debugging timeouts.
* Added 'serif' css option.
* Bugfix in [thread] mode: properly recognize start of comments; not
  doing so sometimes causes a server error (html output without
  content-type).
* Bugfix in comment debug mode, for same reason as above.
* Change algorithm for [thread] (every comment that does not start
  with "Re:"). This is more reliable and compatible with compressed
  top-level comments. 
* Add 'read the rest of this comment' using the [thread]
  mechanism. However, Slashdot handles this in a mysterious way.
* Move CSS to css/ subdirectory. Add 'css_dist.txt' file containing
  the CSS files for this release, to avoid cluttering the skin
  selection list with old CSS versions after an update. User-specific
  CSS files can be defined in css_local.txt, which should NOT be
  included with the distribution.
* Add [thread] links to top-level comments; this will show comments
  that are hidden in the regular story pages if there are more than 50
  comments in the story.
* Change bigfont, smallfont to font-l and font-b; changed default font
  sizes.
* add 'debugging.txt' with some undocumented options.
* Experimenting with browser sniffing; absolute path in
  apple-touch-icon for Android
* CSS: remove redundancy; make 'hugefont' a bit larger
* CSS option 'bigbutton' (doesn't seem to help on Android 1.6, though)

v4.1 (10th April 2011)
* URL replacement scheme updated to now support redirecting wikipedia,
  xkcd and youtube references to the mobile version.
* Many config options are now moved away from the config file and onto the
  "About/Preferences" page. This allows different reading options on a
  per-device basis.
* Added an option for hidden main pages to be shown in a different colour
  scheme.
* If there is a parsing problem, you can now force AvantSlash to check
  for an update.
* Slashdot-truncated comments for threshold <= 1 now get an [expand] link.
* Viewport settings removed as now can be detected automatically.
* Added an option so that comments can be displayed indented to allow you
  to easily follow who is replying to what post.
* Number of bug fixes relating to expanding messages, debugging mode,
  update checking and blockquotes in postings not being closed.
* Updated credits to include cache statistics.
* Book reviews are now correctly parsed.
* Favicon and iOS icons added.


v4.0 (6th March 2011)
* The location of avantify.config is taken from the current working
  directory, so that (the majority of) users will not need to edit the
  script to make it work.
* Some leftover html tags (e.g. </a> in the score) are now removed.
* Added more non-printing whitespace in the html output to make debugging
  easier.
* Improved the debugging output: better removal of attributes inside html
  tags.
* Now supports expanding truncated comments for javascript-capable browsers
  and optionally abbreviating low-score comments.
* Now downloads the regular dynamic slashdot pages, instead of trying to
  deal with the buggy and unstable legacy versions.
* Some code cleanup: parsing of front page in separate function; pruned
  apparently obsolete code, moved other stuff in separate subroutines.
* Add links to previous issues, up to 5 days ago, on front page.
* Improved debugging messages.
* New layout templating system allowing for on-the-fly changes to the
  stylesheets depending on which looks better on various devices.

v3.19 (30th November 2010) by Han-Kwang Nienhuys
* Correct the issue with comment thresholds not working as they should.
* Updated the regexp to extract the author again, and the control flow to
  start comment output.
* Changed the DUMP_REFORMATTED_HTML option: 2=as it used to be;
  1=output html as it is being parsed.
* Remove onclick=... from the tags so that it's easier to eyeball the
  raw html code.
* Updated copyright so that it is correct each year.

  phones are now automatically shortened.

  for all the fixes).
* Fixed a bug which meant that some of the smaller stories were not being
  displayed on the mainpage.

v3.10 (10th February 2007)
* Updated code to work around Slashdot's bizzare insistence that 
  requests to the main page have a referer of slashdot.org.
* Updated the issue functionality to work with Slashdot's recent HTML 
  change which was missed in v3.9.  Many thanks to Ithier de Lestrange

* Fixed yet another Slashdot fiddle where they added a space in a

* Updated code to support the HTML changes on the Slashdot main page.
* Corrected the CHANGELOG to reflect the right version numbers.

  as they decided to insert a space into a heading tag.

v3.0 (1st June 2005)
 - Updated code to remove additional newline before the (read more) link.
 - Removed all configuration from the main script and placed it into
   a seperate file. This means that future updates won't mean that you

   each referenced article on the main page.

   it to break again
 - If a comment gets truncated for being too long, AvantSlash will now
   indicate this.

v2.30 (17th March 2005)
 - Updated code to cope with Slashdot HTML change (they've converted their
   table tags to lovercase, not sure what that achieves)

v2.29 (18th January 2005)
 - Updated the advert filter code.

v2.28 (2nd November 2004)
 - Fixed bug where AvantSlash would prefer showing WML to web browsers that
   support both WML and HTML. This was a problem especially with Pocket
   Internet Explorer on the Microsoft Smartphone and PocketPC Phone Edition.

 - Fixed bug which means that if you viewed the site on a WAP phone, you
   weren't correctly redirected to the Google WML to HTML converter.

   below it being shown.

v2.20 (20th April 2003)

   the story on the comments page being displayed.

   supplying the fix)

 - Fixed error message caused by incorrect @ (thanks to Kevin Martin for
   spotting that one)
 - Fixed it so that if you have internalize_links set to zero, you can't
   use the external=1 paramater to clean HTML. This came about because some
   prat at 63.169.220.2 (firebox.mbe-eng.com) used my script to clean up
   the Newsweek Site Index on MSNBC (and other links not used by slashdot)
   and ended up twatting the server good and hard.
 - Set internalize_links default option to 0 (off) in light of the above.

v2.16 (21st February 2003)
* Fixed "Read more" page not showing anything due to changes in Slashdots
  HTML (thanks to Joe Maiorana for supplying the fix)

v2.15 (5th February 2003)
* Added option to limit the maximum number of comments shown (thanks to
  Charles McNulty for the code)

  Joe Maiorana for supplying the fix)

  so it doesn't wrap on my Palm Vx

v2.10 (2nd August 2002)
* Fixed missing content-type header in credits (thanks to Dan Fabulich for
  spotting it)

  how recent it is.

* Removed large header at the bottom of each page for a credits page

  reach your page limit

  (thanks to Glenn Phillips for the suggestion)

v2.2 (26th October 2001)

  that you don't have to scroll down and then back up to link to the
  article.
* Changed copyright symbol to &copy; for cleaner HTML.
* Added an option to remove italics from the output so that Palm Pilot
  versions of Avantgo don't render everything in bold (which in my opinion
  looks horrible and is difficult to read).

v2.0 (30 August 2001)
* New major version number, entirely new code. Now properly parses the
  main site, allows you to toggle items on and off and the horriffic
  searches and replaces have been replaced with pattern matches.
* Released under the GNU GPL. The last licence was fine, but thought
  I might as well support the organisation that provided these nice
  free tools.

v1.4 (29 August 2001)
* Quick hacks to get it working under Slash 2.2. Some stuff that 
  shouldn't show, now does, but its better than nothing. Next version
  will be 2.0 and need a total rewrite *sigh*
