For developing AvantSlash, there are a few features to help
debugging. You can set DEBUGGING to 1 or 2 in avantify.config. But
there are also some CGI parameters that you can append to the URL.

* ua - override browser User-Agent, in order to test parts of the code
  that generate HTML output depending on the user agent.

  Example: &ua=iPhone

* debug - override DEBUGGING configuration setting

  Example: &debug=2

* force_reload - ignore cached data and reload from the slashdot
  server.

  Example: &force_reload=1

* style - override skin setting from configuration or cookie.

  Example: &style=desktop_slashdot,noitalic
