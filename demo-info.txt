<p>This is the demo mode for Avantslash, with the purpose of letting
you try AvantSlash before installing it on your own web server. It is
not meant as a replacement for a private AvantSlash installation; it's
functionality is intentionally reduced in order to prevent overloading
this server and in order to prevent getting blacklisted by
slashdot.org.

<p>To get the AvantSlash scripts, go to <a
href="http://www.fourteenminutes.com/code/avantslash/">http://www.fourteenminutes.com/code/avantslash/</a>.
You will be able to see the actual front page, in stead of old news,
see more stories and comments, and search for stories.
